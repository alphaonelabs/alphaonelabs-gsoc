## 🚀 Quick Start

The site is built with vanilla HTML and Tailwind CSS (loaded via CDN), making it lightweight and easy to maintain.

### GitHub Pages Setup

This repository is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` or `master` branch. The deployment is handled by a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).

**To enable GitHub Pages:**
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
4. The site will be automatically deployed when you push to the main branch

### Local Development

To view the site locally, simply open `index.html` in your web browser:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alphaonelabs/alphaonelabs-gsoc.git
cd alphaonelabs-gsoc

# Open in browser (macOS)
open index.html

# Open in browser (Linux)
xdg-open index.html

# Open in browser (Windows)
start index.html
```

Alternatively, use a local server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (with http-server)
npx http-server

# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```
